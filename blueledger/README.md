## M-Pesa SMS Listener

This feature allows the app to automatically track M-Pesa transactions by reading SMS messages.

### Limitations

*   **Android-only:** This feature is only available on Android devices. It will be disabled on other platforms.
*   **SMS Permission:** The app requires permission to read SMS messages. The user will be prompted to grant this permission.
*   **Message Format:** The feature relies on parsing the content of M-Pesa SMS messages. It has been designed to work with a variety of common M-Pesa message formats, but it may not be able to parse all messages correctly.

### Expected M-Pesa Message Formats

The SMS parser is designed to recognize the following patterns.

**Income:**
- `[CODE] Confirmed. You have received Ksh[AMOUNT] from [SENDER] on [DATE] at [TIME] New M-PESA balance is Ksh[BALANCE].`

**Expenses:**
- `[CODE] Confirmed. Ksh[AMOUNT] sent to [RECIPIENT] on [DATE] at [TIME]. New M-PESA balance is Ksh[BALANCE].`
- `[CODE] Confirmed. Ksh[AMOUNT] paid to [MERCHANT] for account [ACCOUNT] on [DATE] at [TIME]. New M-PESA balance is Ksh[BALANCE].`
- `[CODE] Confirmed. Ksh[AMOUNT] paid to [MERCHANT] on [DATE] at [TIME]. New M-PESA balance is Ksh[BALANCE].`
- `[CODE] Confirmed. Ksh[AMOUNT] airtime bought for [PHONE_NUMBER] on [DATE] at [TIME]. New M-PESA balance is Ksh[BALANCE].`
- `[CODE] Confirmed. Ksh[AMOUNT] withdrawn from agent [AGENT_ID] at [LOCATION] on [DATE] at [TIME]. New M-PESA balance is Ksh[BALANCE].`
